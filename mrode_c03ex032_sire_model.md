Sire model
==========

Model
-----

Here we apply a sire model to the previous data. The mathematical model is the same as the previous section but the individual genetic effect is replaced with the sire genetic effect. In this model, we consider as if an observation belongs to the sire of the animal rather than to the animal itself. Additive genetic variation is explained by sires. So, the sire variance is $\sigma_s^2 = 0.25\sigma_u^2 = 5$ and the residual variance absorbs the remaining part of genetic variance and $\sigma_e^{2*}=0.75\sigma_u^2+\sigma_e^2=55$. The phenotypic variance is the same (60) between the animal and sire models.

Files
-----

We can use the same data set shown in the previous section (`data_mr03b.txt`). In this case, we use the 3rd column (sire ID) instead of the 1st column (animal ID) as an animal's effect.

The pedigree file in sire model for BLUPF90 is different from the one used in the animal model. This file (`pedigree_mr03b.txt`) contains 3 columns:

1. The ID for sire.
2. The ID for sire of the sire.
3. The ID for maternal grandsire (MGS) of the sire.

In this case, all MGS are unknown so the 3rd column should be 0 for all animals.

The parameter file is also altered. We put comments around lines to be changed.

The value `add_sire` is a keyword for the sire model in BLUPF90. The pedigree file does not have sire 2 because it is missing, but the program does not care about it.

Solutions
---------

The solutions are following.

   1   1         1          4.33567107
   1   1         2          3.38198579

   1   2         4         -0.04304180
~~~~~

The solution for sire ID 2 is 0.0. BLUPF90 always produces the solution 0.0 for such a missing level in data and pedigree files. Otherwise, the solutions are identical to the textbook (pp.48).
