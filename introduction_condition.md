About the software
==================

Condition of use
----------------

For detailed information about the conditions of use and support, please visit the official wiki (<http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php>). The programs are free for research use, but publications should acknowledge the use of the programs. Please contact the UGA faculty (see <http://nce.ads.uga.edu/> for contact information).

Bug report and support
----------------------

Bug reports are welcome. Please contact one of the developers at UGA or other institutes, or post your report on Groups.io (<https://groups.io/g/blupf90>). Support may be limited on Groups.io because it is provided on a volunteer basis. Note that we have moved from Yahoo Groups to Groups.io due to changes in Yahoo's policy. If you need full support for the programs, please consider visiting our team.
