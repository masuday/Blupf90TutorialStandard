Actual genetic evaluation often handles a large data set. Although the specific program `blupf90` can read quite large data and pedigree files ( for instance 1 million animals depending on the available memory), it will fail in a large-scale analysis with tens of millions of individuals. Some special software is available for such a purpose with a special contract with the development team at UGA. A member of our team can access and test the software supporting the large data set. In this chapter, we will explain the usage of the programs for large-scale genetic evaluations.
