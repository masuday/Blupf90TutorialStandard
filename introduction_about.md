About this tutorial
===================

General information
-------------------

This document explains how to describe a model in a parameter file used with the BLUPF90 family of programs, how to prepare data and pedigree files, and how to perform genomic analyses with the programs. This tutorial assumes that the reader has sufficient knowledge of linear mixed models and data manipulation techniques on a computer. Experience with similar software will also be helpful for understanding the contents.

Features of the BLUPF90 program are introduced in an introductory style. In particular, the first section of each chapter presents essential features using a very simple example. Later sections introduce new concepts through more practical examples. We recommend that readers do not skip any sections, even if they seem too elementary.

This tutorial complements the official manual and wiki pages. Because the official manual serves more as a reference, it presents each topic concisely. For advanced topics or technical tricks, please refer to the manual. Conversely, if you find that something is missing in the manual, this tutorial may help you understand the background. If you have a question that is not addressed in the manual, the wiki, or this tutorial, please ask someone in the Yahoo Group (`https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/blupf90/info`). You may find answers in the historical discussion logs of the forum.

Examples in each section
------------------------

### Example data

In each section, I will provide various examples for the reader. The files are available at the author's GitHub repository (`https://github.com/masuday/data`). Examples in this tutorial are enclosed in a frame, as shown below.

TODO
----

These changes can be made in the next edition.

- Fully revise the descriptions to support the new programs `blupf90+` and `gibbsf90+`.
- Fully revise the chapters related to Dr. Mrode's textbook. The textbook has been updated (now in its 4th edition, "Linear Models for the Prediction of the Genetic Merit of Animals"), and a new author, Ivan PocrniÄ‡, has joined. The numerical examples are now freely available online, and the revised chapters will make use of these materials.
- Add additional explanations on the usage of other programs, such as `idsolf90`.
