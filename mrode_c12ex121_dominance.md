Animal model with dominance effect
==================================

Model
-----

Linear mixed models can handle a non-additive genetic model with dominance or epistatic relationship matrices. In the dominance model, we can consider the additive genetic effect and the dominance effect simultaneously. In this example, the author assumes the animal model with one fixed effect, the additive genetic effect, the dominance effect, and the residual effect. In this example, the additive variance $\sigma_u^2 = 90$, the dominance variance $\sigma_d^2 = 80$, and the residual variance $\sigma_e^2 = 120$. BLUPF90 does not have a function to calculate $\mathbf{D}^{-1}$, so we need to supply the elements as a file to the program.

Files
-----

A data file (`data_mr12a.txt`) should be prepared. The pedigree file (`pedigree_mr12a.txt`) is also created.

The inverse of the dominance relationship matrix is supplied as a text file. See the textbook for details (p.207).

The parameter file defines 2 random effects.
