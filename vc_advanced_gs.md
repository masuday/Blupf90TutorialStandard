Advanced features in Gibbs sampling programs
============================================

Heterogeneous residual variances
--------------------------------

GIBBS3F90 supports heterogeneous residual variances defined by a class. Here we will demonstrate an analysis with the heterogeneity in residual variance.

### Files ###

We use the same data and pedigree file as before.

- [`simdata2.txt`](https://github.com/Masuday/data/blob/master/tutorial/simdata2.txt) : data file
- [`simped2.txt`](https://github.com/Masuday/data/blob/master/tutorial/simped2.txt) : pedigree file

The pedigree file contains three columns: animal, sire, and dam. The data file has 12 columns as described below.

Column Item          type      description
------ ---------     -------   ----------------------------------
1      Animal ID     integer   Same as in pedigree (4641 animals)
2      Sire ID       integer   Same as in pedigree
3      Dam ID        integer   Same as in pedigree
4      Weight        real      Not used here
5      Mu            integer   All 1: not used here
6      Farm          integer   Class effect (155 levels)
7      Sex           integer   Class effect (2 levels)
8      Year          integer   Class effect (11 levels)
9      Obs. 1        real      Phenotype for trait 1
10     Obs. 2        real      Phenotype for trait 2
11     Obs. 3        real      Phenotype for trait 3
12     Obs. 4        real      Phenotype for trait 4
13     Covariate     real      Not used
14     Class         integer   Heterogeneous residual class

The 14th column contains the heterogeneous-residual-variance class (3 levels) which is used in this section.

The parameter file has one option to define the heterogeneous residual class.

OPTION hetres_int 14 3
~~~~~

The option has 2 arguments.

- `OPTION hetres_int` = defines the heterogeneous residual class with two values: 1) the position of the class in the data file and 2) the maximum level in the class.

In this case, we specify that the 14th column has 3 levels.

With 20,000 samples (saved each 10 samples) with 10,000 burn-in, the following results can be found.

~~~~~{language=output}
 ave G
   39.845
 SD G
	3.9917
 ave R
	72.313
 SD R
	3.9497
 ave R
   78.248
 SD R
   4.4558
 ave R
  80.646
 SD R
   4.3320
~~~~~

There are 3 `ave_R` (and `SD_R`) blocks. The first one corresponds to the variance in heterogeneous level 1, the second line for level 2 and so on. Compare the above estimates to the results from AIREMLF90 shown in the previous section.


Restart the sampling
--------------------

After the sampling, you would find more samples are needed. The Gibbs sampling programs support to restart the sampling from the end point of the previous run. Any Gibbs samplers in recent BLUPF90 programs support this feature.

When the Gibbs sampler finishes sampling, 4 files will be created. To continue the sampling, all the files are required.

- `binary_final_solutions` = Posterior means and SDs for location parameters
- `last_solutions` = The last samples for location parameters
- `fort.99` = Values needed for DIC
- `gibbs_samples` = Sampled variance components

If you want to restart the sampling, you have to add an option to the parameter file. It needs the number of samples drawn in the previous run. If you had 10000 samples, the option should be

~~~~~{language=blupf90}
OPTION cont 10000
~~~~~

where 10000 is the number of samples obtained previously. Run the Gibbs sampler with a parameter file with the above option, and the program restarts the sampling (from 10001 in the example).


Extraction of solutions from binary final solutions
---------------------------------------------------

The file `binary_final_solutions` contains the posterior mean of a location parameter (that is a solution of "fixed" or "random" effect). This file is saved as a non-text format. The following Fortran program can extract the solutions and print them to a file `final_solutions.txt`. You can compile the program using a Fortran compiler (like GFortran) and run it in a directory where the binary final solutions are. The output format is equivalent to BLUPF90 with `OPTION sol_se`.

~~~~~{language=Fortran caption="\url{binsol_to_textsol.f90}"}
program binsol_to_textsol
	implicit none
	integer :: io, t, e, l
	double precision :: v, sol, se
	open(10, file='binary_final_solutions', form='unformatted', &
		status='old', iostat=io)
	if(io /= 0) stop
	open(20, file='final_solutions.txt')
	write(20,'(" trait / effect level solution               s.e.")')
	do
		read(10, iostat=io) t,e,l,sol,se
		if(io /= 0) exit
		write(20, '(2i4,i10,2f20.8)') t,e,l,sol,se
	end do
	close(10)
	close(20)
end program binsol_to_textsol
~~~~~

Output of POSTGIBBSF90
----------------------

The POSTGIBBSF90 program shows many diagnoses for the Gibbs samples. Here we just show the basic ideas for the information.

- `MCE` = Monte Carlo error, corresponding to the ''standard error'' of the posterior mean of a parameter ($\hat{\mu}-\mu$).
- `Mean` = Posterior mean of a parameter.
- `HPD` = High probability density within 95%, close idea to ''95% confidence interval'' in frequentist approach.
- `Effective sample size` = Number of samples after deducting auto-correlation among samples.
- `Median` = Posterior median of a parameter.
- `Mode` = Posterior mode of a parameter; just an approximation.
- `Independent chain size`
- `PSD` = Posterior standard deviation of a parameter.
- `Mean` = the same as those used above.
- `PSD Interval (95%)` = Lower and upper bounds of Mean $\pm$ 1.96PSD.
- Geweke diagnostic = Convergence diagnosis; could be converged if this is $< 1.0$ (according to the official manual, this is almost useless because this is $< 1.0$ in almost all cases).
- `Autocorrelations` = Lag-correlations with lag 1, 10 and 50; calculated for the saved samples.
- `Independent # batches` = The effective number of blocks after deducting the auto-correlation among samples.
