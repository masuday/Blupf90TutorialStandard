Common environmental effects as random
======================================

Model
-----

In this example, the author considers a simple maternal model and the maternal effects ($c$) do not correlate to
each other. The variance components include the animal genetic variance $\sigma_u^2=20$, the maternal variance $\sigma_c^2=15$, and the residual variance $\sigma_e^2=65$.

Files
-----

The data file (`data_mr04b.txt`) contains the whole table shown in the textbook (p.68). Here is the explanation for each column.

1. Animal ID (piglet)
2. Sire ID
3. Dam ID
4. Sex (1=male and 2=female)
5. Weaning weight (kg)

Pedigree (`pedigree_mr04b.txt`) can be derived from the above data.

The parameter file should contain 2 random effects.
