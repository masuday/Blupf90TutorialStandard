Perfroming GBLUP
================

GBLUP with BLUPF90
------------------

### Background

BLUPF90 can perform GBLUP, but you will need a trick to do this because BLUPF90 always performs single-step GBLUP, and the program does not have a "GBLUP-mode". In the single-step approach, the inverse of a relationship matrix consists of three dense matrices as seen in the previous chapters.

$$
\mathbf{H}^{-1}
=
\mathbf{A}^{-1}
+
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{G}^{-1}-\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}
\end{array}
\right]
$$

BLUPF90 always creates all three matrices ($\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$, and $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$) by default when the genomic relationship matrix is used. In other words, whenever the program creates $\mathbf{G}$, the program always requires a pedigree file even though the pedigree information is not really used in the program. You have to trick the program to use a dummy pedigree file which nullifies the pedigree relationships in $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$, or not to create the pedigree relationship matrices at all.

There are several methods to perform GBLUP using BLUPF90. The user can choose one of them.

- **Use of a dummy pedigree-file.** RENUMF90 prepares such a dummy file. This is the simplest way, and it is always the first choice.
- **Use of the user-supplied text file for $\mathbf{G}$**. It is useful only if you want to use customized genomic relationships and you can prepare the matrix as a file by yourself.
- **Use of a special option in the parameter file.** It skips $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ in a combination of the zero weight on $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$. It is useful only if you have to adjust $\mathbf{G}$ with the pedigree relationships but you do not need the pedigree relationships in the final equations.

We will explain all of them in the subsequent sections. The last two methods have been explained in the previous chapters.

### Model

Before introducing the way to apply GBLUP in BLUPF90, we clarify the model used in GBLUP. We assume the model has some fixed effects ($\mathbf{b}$) and the additive genomic effect ($\mathbf{u}$). An animal is assumed to have only one phenotype. The matrix notation of the model is as follows.

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Xb} + \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{e}
$$

The phenotype can be a pseudo-observation such as a daughter yield deviation (DYD), progeny trait deviation (PTD), de-regressed proof (DRP), and so on. When using the pseudo phenotype, each observation has different accuracy, so we should consider a weight that reflects the accuracy of the observation. Furthermore, we need to know the variance components ($\sigma_{u}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{e}^{2}$ in the case) or the variance ratio ($\lambda=\sigma_{e}^{2}/\sigma_{u}^{2}$) as in the standard animal model. The system of mixed model equations is easily derived.

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{W}\mathbf{X}\sigma_{e}^{-2}& \mathbf{X}'\mathbf{W}\sigma_{e}^{-2}\\
\mathbf{W}\mathbf{X}\sigma_{e}^{-2} & \mathbf{W}\sigma_{e}^{-2} + \mathbf{G}^{-1}\sigma_{u}^{-2}
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{l}
\mathbf{\hat{b}} \\
\mathbf{\hat{u}}
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{l}
\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{W}\mathbf{y}\sigma_{e}^{-2}\\
\mathbf{W}\mathbf{y}\sigma_{e}^{-2}
\end{array}
\right]
$$

The diagonal matrix, $\mathbf{W}$, has a weight corresponding to each observation. In the following section, we assume $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{1}$ so that we have the general mean as the only fixed effect.


The simplest way with dummy pedigree
------------------------------------

### Idea

The simplest approach is to prepare the data using RENUMF90 using a *dummy* pedigree-file. RENUMF90 creates such a pedigree file that only contains the genotyped animals whose parents are missing (unknown). With this pedigree file, the pedigree relationship matrix is equal to $\mathbf{I}$.

If all animals are genotyped, all three matrices in $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ ($\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$, and $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$) have the same size. Also, we have the equivalence: $\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}=\mathbf{I}$. The resulting $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ has $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ only because the pedigree matrices are canceled out.

$$
\mathbf{H}^{-1} = \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{G}^{-1} - \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{G}^{-1}
$$

The user must know that BLUPF90 does not avoid creating the identity matrices $\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}=\mathbf{I}$. These matrices are explicitly calculated and surely added to the system of equations, and in the end, two $\mathbf{I}$s will be canceled out *numerically*. This method just provides the same solutions as omitting $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$ from $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ numerically, but actually not omitted in operation. This is because BLUPF90 by design reads the pedigree file and build $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$ whenever $\mathbf{G}$ is created.

### Numerical example

We will use an example considered in the earlier chapter. There are 15 genotyped animals but only the first 11 animals have phenotypes. The data file has 4 columns with 1) animal ID, 2) group code that is general mean, 3) observation and 4) weight on observation. This file is also the same as the previous one but it has the original ID corresponding to the marker file. If you do not use the weight, you can omit the column 4 from the data file.

There is no pedigree file for this data.

In this dataset, some animals do not have phenotypes, and this is a typical case in GBLUP. `RENUMF90` will create the dummy pedigree-file for all genotyped animals in the marker file. The number of pedigree animals will be the same as the number of genotyped animals, and BLUPF90 properly performs GBLUP.

### Renumbering

An instruction file for `RENUMF90` is as follows. We assume $\sigma_{u}^{2}=0.3$ and $\sigma_{e}^2=0.7$. If you do not need the weight, you can put the empty line to `WEIGHT` (this keyword is mandatory so you should keep it even if you do not use the weights).

~~~

The last two lines are the options for BLUPF90 (passed through the resulting parameter file `renf90.par`). The first option, `AlphaBeta`, is needed to make $\mathbf{G}$ be positive definite. It performs the blending $\mathbf{G}\leftarrow 0.95\mathbf{G}+0.05\mathbf{A}_{22}=0.95\mathbf{G}+0.05\mathbf{I}$. The second option `tunedG 0` turns off the _tuning_ to scale $\mathbf{G}$ to $\mathbf{A}_{22}$; see the previous section for details. In this analysis, $\mathbf{A}_{22}$ is just a dummy (the identity matrix) so there is no reason to perform the tuning. You can also put any options you need in the parameter file.

Note that there is no `FILE` keyword for pedigree, but the program generates the dummy pedigree-file. After running `RENUMF90`, you will see the pedigree file `renadd02.ped` in the same directory.

The renumbering process assigns an integer code to each of genotyped animals. The first column (animal ID) is filled with genotyped animals but the 2nd and the 3rd columns (parents) are 0 that is missing. This creates the identity matrix as the pedigree relationships. The 10th column has the original ID corresponding to the integer (renumbered) code.

The cross-reference file (XrefID) clearly shows the correspondence between the integer code and the original ID. The integer code is randomly assigned to the original ID; the user should not expect any meaningful order in the integer code.

### Running GBLUP

BLUPF90 calculates the solution of mixed model equations.

   1   2        15          0.26284875
~~~

The solution of the genomic effect is in rows with effect 2 (rows with `2` in the 2nd column). The individual solution is labeled with the integer code (not the original ID), so the user has to manually combine the solutions with the original ID using the pedigree file or the XrefID file. If Bash is available, the following command immediately combines the solutions with the original ID, sorted by the original ID.

~~~{language=shell}
paste <(sort -n snp6.txt_XrefID) <(awk '$2==2{print $3,$4}' solutions) | sort -k2,2
~~~

### Remarks

This method will work correctly unless non-genotyped animals have phenotypes. So what will happen when non-genotyped animals have observations? The non-genotyped animals will be included in the equations and have some solutions. However, the solutions are nonsense because those animals are not related to the other animals, and the estimates are just artifact. The user is responsible for the data used in GBLUP.


Genomic relationship matrix as a external text file
---------------------------------------------------

As explained in the previous chapter, the user can supply $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ as a text file. The users should prepare the file by themselves using external software like R. In this case, BLUPF90 does not need the marker file.

The text file contains 3 columns: 1) row index, 2) column index, and 3) the value of the element in $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$. Only the lower or upper triangular part is needed; the program stops if the file has the entire matrix. The data file should be renumbered; only numerical expressions are allowed for an ID of genotyped animal and it should be corresponding to the index in the file of $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$.

### Numerical example

Here we will use the same example as the previous section to use the external text file. There are 15 genotyped animals but only the first 11 animals have phenotypes. The external file of $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ (`ginverse6.txt`) is too large to show here. Only the first some rows will be presented. The whole file is available at <https://githib.com/masuday/data> on Github.

This file is obtained from the marker file shown above (`snp6.txt`) so the index of a matrix is the same as the order of animals in the marker file.

The data file has 4 columns with 1) animal ID, 2) group code that is general mean, 3) observation, 4) weight on observation, and 5) the original ID, just for your information (it has characters but no problem because this column is never read by the program). The animal ID should be compatible with the external file of $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$.

Be careful to read the results; the order in `solutions` is different from the previous one. The user must combine the solutions with the original ID. The following command correctly sorts the solutions by the original ID.

~~~

### Remarks

This method does not need RENUMF90. It is useful for simulated data that has renumbered ID. A problem is to compute $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ with the external programs. Also, this method may be slow in reading the file when the matrix is too large.


GBLUP with partial use of pedigree
----------------------------------

There is a case where a pedigree file is available but the user should perform GBLUP. The pedigree information can be used to form $\mathbf{G}$ but the final equations contain $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ only. Or, the user can perform GBLUP with the (residual) polygenic effect which is explained with the additive relationship matrix. The method introduced here is general and flexible but a bit complicated. We will use two software: PREGSF90 for preparation and BLUPF90 for prediction as to the following protocol.

1. Run RENUMF90 to generate renumbered data and `renf90.par`.
2. Run PREGSF90 with `renf90.par`.
3. Make a copy of `renf90.f90`, modify the copy, and run BLUPF90 with the modified parameter file


### Renumbering

In this method, we will use the same marker and data files (`snp6.txt` and `rawdata6.txt`) as the previous section. The pedigree file is shown below.

The user can use any options for genomic setup. The option `TauOmega` is needed to remove $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$ from $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$. The user can put more options to be suitable for your data.

Run RENUMF90, and several files including `renf90.par` will be created.

### Run PREGSF90

First, look at `renf90.par` to see what we are going to do with it.

PREGSF90 calculates the relationship matrices as follows.

1. Compute $\mathbf{A}_{22}$.
2. Compute $\mathbf{G}$.
3. Blend two matrices as $\mathbf{G}\leftarrow \alpha\mathbf{G}+\beta\mathbf{A}_{22}$.
4. Scale $\mathbf{G}$ to $\mathbf{A}_{22}$ (_tuning_).
5. Compute $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$.
6. Compute $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$.
7. Merge two inverse matrices to $\Delta=\tau\mathbf{G}^{-1}-\omega\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$ and save it to a file `GimA22i`.

Note that PREGSF90 does not compute $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ itself, which will be computed with BLUPF90 from the pedigree file. Using above parameter file, by default, $\alpha=0.95$ and $\beta=0.05$ and the pedigree matrix is integrated to $\mathbf{G}$, the tuning is performed, and `GimA22i` will have only $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$ because of $\omega=0$. Again, the above configurations are just to demonstrate the capability of PREGSF90/BLUPF90 in GBLUP. Please use appropriate options for the user's data.

After running PREGSF90, several files will be created in the working directory. There should be a file `GimA22i`.

### Run BLUPF90

BLUPF90 needs a separate parameter file that is slightly different from `renf90.par` used in PREGSF90. Make a copy of `renf90.par` as `blup.par` then modify the options in the copy as follows (showing only options).

~~~{language=blupf90 caption=blup.par}
OPTION SNP_file snp6.txt
OPTION readGimA22i
OPTION omit_ainv
~~~

The first option `SNP_file` should be kept in the file. The remaining two options are crucial: `OPTION readGimA22i` reads the file `GimA22i` as $\Delta$ instead of computing it from data, and `OPTION omit_ainv` suppresses the creation of $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. In the end, $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ has only $\mathbf{G}^{-1}$.

Run BLUPF90 with `blup.par`, and obtain the solution file. The solutions look similar to the previous analysis for some animals (especially the young one) but very different in the other animals (the older one). This is because, in this study, $\mathbf{G}$ was blended with $\mathbf{A}_{22}$ and it can capture the residual polygenic effect.

### Remarks

#### Dummy pedigree to remove A-inverse

The option `omit_ainv` is effective only in BLUPF90. If this option does not work (or you are not sure the program supports it), use the alternative approach to remove $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. First, create a _dummy_ pedigree file including only 0 in all 3 (or 4) columns. The pedigree file should have the same (or more) number of lines as the number of genotyped animals. The _awk_ program easily creates the dummy pedigree. The following command assumes the renumbered pedigree is `renadd02.ped` and writes 4 columns in case of unknown parent groups.

~~~{language=shell}
awk '{print 0,0,0,0}' renadd02.ped > dummy.ped
~~~

Then, modify `blup.par` to have `dummy.ped` instead of `renadd02.ped`. With this trick, $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ becomes $\mathbf{0}$ so no contribution to the equations.

#### Pure GBLUP without pedigree effect

Even with the pedigree file, the user can run GBLUP without any contribution from pedigree information (that is $\mathbf{A}_{22}$). In this case, the solutions should be identical to one obtained in the previous two methods.

To do this, the user can put the following options in the renum-instruction file or `renf90.par` for PREGSF90.

~~~~~
OPTION AlphaBeta 0.95 0.00
OPTION GammaDelta 0.05 0.00
OPTION tunedG 0
OPTION TauOmega 1.00 0.00
~~~~~

The first two options will be used in blending: $\mathbf{G}\leftarrow \alpha\mathbf{G}+\beta\mathbf{A}_{22}+\gamma\mathbf{I}+\delta\mathbf{11}'$. The above option specifies $\alpha=0.95$, $\beta=0$, $\gamma=0.05$, and $\delta=0$ so that the blending is $\mathbf{G}\leftarrow 0.95\mathbf{G}+0.05\mathbf{I}$. The option `tunedG 0` prohibits the program to scale $\mathbf{G}$ to $\mathbf{A}_{22}$. These three options are equivalent to the approach that we introduced as the first method in this chapter. The last option removes $\mathbf{A}_{22}^{-1}$ from $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$.

Finally, the user should create a separate parameter file to use `GimA22i` and to omit $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ in BLUPF90 using `omit_ainv` or the dummy pedigree file.
