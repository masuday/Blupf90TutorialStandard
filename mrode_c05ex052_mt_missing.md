Multiple-trait model with equal design matrix and missing records
=================================================================

Model
-----

Here we apply the same model described in the previous example to the data with missing observations. Model descriptions and mixed model equations are identical as before.

With a missing observation, $\mathbf{R}_0$ and its inverse should be altered. For example, assuming a 2 trait model, if the observation of the first trait is missing, the first row and column in $\mathbf{R}_0$ should be zeroed out. The corresponding inverse is the generalized inverse of this altered $\mathbf{R}_0$. Illustrating this situation with the previous example, the result is
$$
\mathbf{R}_{0}
=
\left[
\begin{array}{rr}
0&0\\
0&30
\end{array}
\right]
\quad
\text{and}
\quad
\mathbf{R}_{0}^{-}
=
\left[
\begin{array}{rr}
0&0\\
0&30
\end{array}
\right]^{-}
=
\left[
\begin{array}{rr}
0&0\\
0&1/30
\end{array}
\right].
$$

The generalized inverse of this zeroed matrix is equivalent to the inverse of a matrix containing only nonzero elements in the zeroed matrix (Searle, 1971). BLUPF90 can detect a missing observation and prepares an appropriate $\mathbf{R}_{0}$ and its generalized inverse.


Files
-----

One animal is added to the previous example and 2 observations are marked as missing. The missing observation is indicated as 0, which is the default missing code used in the BLUPF90 family (`data_mr05b.txt`). We can use an extended pedigree file as the previous one by adding the animal 9 (`pedigree_mr05b.txt`).

The parameter file is also identical except for omitting an option for standard error calculations.

You can confirm the results are identical to the values in the textbook (p.80).
