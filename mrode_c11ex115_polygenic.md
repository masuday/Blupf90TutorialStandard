Files and solutions for SNP-BLUP
--------------------------------

First, we perform the SNP-BLUP analysis. The data file (`data_mr11d1.txt`) is from the previous example.

We can use the same pedigree defined before (`pedigree_mr11d1.txt`).

The parameter file contains 10 SNP effects with the residual polygenic effects.

Files and solutions for GBLUP
-----------------------------

In this example with GBLUP, we use a text file for $\mathbf{G}_{w}^{-1}$ created with PREGSF90 in the previous section (the first approach). See the instruction and prepare the file.

The data file (`data_mr11d2.txt`) is also common to the previous one.

The pedigree file is the same as SNP-BLUP.

The parameter file is shown below.
