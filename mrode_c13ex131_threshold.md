The threshold model
===================

Model
-----

Some traits show categorical responses which can be potentially ordered by degree for example, calving difficulty (easy, slightly difficult, or difficult) and disease (no treatment needed, treated, or died). For such traits, although the phenotype is not continuous, we can still assume that both genetic and environmental factors affect the traits and there is the polygenic effect. In this case, it is a reasonable model that each animal has a non-observable, hypothetical random variable like a phenotype in a continuous trait, and such a variable contributes to the categorical response. In this model, various factors can contribute to the underlying variable. When the variable exceeds a certain level, it expresses the different category of response. This is a basic idea of the threshold model and the variable is called liability and the level is known as the threshold. The liability is usually assumed to be normally distributed in an underlying scale. We can apply a linear model to the underlying variable. In this theory, the number of thresholds is equivalent to the number of categories minus 1.

The author cites a well-known data set originally provided by Gianola and Foulley (1983). The trait is calving ease with 3 categories. The sire model for liability is as follows.
$$
l_{ijkl} = H_i +C_j + s_k + e_{ijkl}
$$
where $l_{ijkl}$ is the liability, $H_i$ and $C_j$ are the fixed effects, $s_k$ is the random sire effect and $e_{ijkl}$ is the residual. The variance components are $\sigma_s^2 = 1/19 = 0.0526$ and $\sigma_e^2 = 1.0$.

The BLUPF90 family used to have several software to handle the threshold. Now THRGIBBS1F90 is the only publicly available program. This is Gibbs sampler so we need many samples to estimate the location parameters as the posterior means.

The pedigree file is prepared for the sire model.

The items are different from the animal model.

2. Sire (sire of sire) ID
3. Maternal grand sire ID

The data file is shown below. All the phenotype should be written in the flat file. There are 28 observations from 28 calves (p.223).

The following 2 options are required to perform the threshold analysis with THRGIBBS1F90.

- `OPTION cat` = defines the number of categories. This is a single-trait model so just put one value (3 categories for the trait 1). If you apply a multiple-trait model, supply as many integers as traits. The value 0 specifies that a trait is continuous (that is non-categorical trait).
- `OPTION fixed_var mean` = performs sampling only for the location parameters (that is solutions) with the fixed variance components supplied in the parameter file. This is useful when only the solutions are of interest.


You can run THRGIBBSF90 with many samples. In this example, we try 10,000 samples with 5,000 burn-in and save all the samples after burn-in. It may have too many samples but we make sure we have the converged results.

Note that THRGIBBS1F90 does not estimate the thresholds in this case. If there are 2 thresholds (3 categories), the program assumes two thresholds are fixed to be 0 and 1. If there is 1 threshold (2 categories), the program fixes the value to 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{11} &= \Phi(t_1 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1) = 0.758\\
P_{12} &= \Phi(t_2 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1) - \Phi(t_1 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1) = 0.197\\
P_{13} &= 1 - \Phi(t_2 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1) = 0.044
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\Phi(x)$ is the cumulative density normal function for example, `pnorm()` in R. The reference values are $P_{11} = 0.800$, $P_{12} = 0.129$, and $P_{13} = 0.071$. The results are apparently different from the textbook. Why? There are 2 possible reasons why the results do not match.

The first one, which is minor, is over-constraint equations. The author put 2 zero-constraint to the equations. Although the left-hand side (LHS) of the equations has very small 2 eigenvalues, it is not small enough to drop the rank of LHS. The problem is in the linear model. The author put the same constraints to the corresponding linear model analysis but it is inappropriate.

The second one is from fixed thresholds with $\sigma_e^2 = 1.0$. When the number of categories ($c$) is 2 that is binary traits, there is only 1 threshold and its value can be arbitrarily fixed. When $c = 3$, we have 2 ways to parameterize the thresholds: 1) one threshold is fixed and another threshold is estimated, or 2) both thresholds are fixed and $\sigma_e^2$ is estimated (that is $\sigma_e^2$ is no longer fixed to 1.0). With the latter parameterization, we need to estimate $c-3$ threshold parameters in addition to $\sigma_e^2$. THRGIBBS1F90 uses this parameterization, so we need appropriate $\sigma_e^2$ instead of 1.0 for the fixed thresholds. In the above example, the residual variance was not appropriate. A question is why this software implements the model in this way. In the variance component estimation using Gibbs sampling for a threshold model with 3 or more categories (2 or more thresholds), the convergence rate for a threshold parameter is very slow. The sampling of residual variance is a better strategy when 2 or more thresholds are assumed in the model. See Sorensen et al. (1995) or Wang et al. (1997) for the detailed discussion. Thus, it may happen that `OPTION fixed_var mean` is not such a good idea. You may explore this by yourself.


Reasonable solutions
--------------------

In this subsection, we will find ways to obtain the same solutions to the textbook. First, we try CBLUPF90THR which is available from our web server. This program supports the computation of 2 or more thresholds in a single-trait threshold model. [^3]

The program implements Hoeschele et al. (1995) which generalized Foulley et al. (1983) and Janss and Foulley (1993) with some unpublished work by Richard Quaas (presented at a meeting of Beef Improvement Federation).

[^3]: Actually, it supports a multiple-trait model with one threshold trait and many linear traits.

The following results are from the program with the same parameter file with many iterations enough to converge (100 rounds here).

  1  3       3      0.0412
  1  3       4     -0.0660
~~~~~

The thresholds are $t_1 = -0.0550$ and $t_2 = 0.5748$. The difference between thresholds is $t_2 - t_1 = 0.6298$ and it is the same as the reference analysis. With above solutions, $P_{11} = 0.800$, $P_{12} = 0.130$, and $P_{13} = 0.070$. The results are nearly identical to the reference values in the textbook.

Then, we try to run THRGIBBS1F90 with a different residual variance. Let's try $\sigma_e^2 = 3.0$. To keep the same variance ratio, $\sigma_s^2$ should be 0.158 to be $\sigma_e^2/\sigma_s^2 = 19.0$. The thresholds are fixed to $t_1 = 0.0$ and $t_2 = 1.0$. The final solutions from THRGIBBS1F90 are as follows.

When $\sigma_e^2 \neq 1.0$, we should standardize the liability predictor with the residual standard deviation before applying the cumulative normal function to calculate the probabilities. See the following computations.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{11} &= \Phi\left( \frac{t_1 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1}{\sigma_e} \right) = 0.813\\
P_{12} &= \Phi\left( \frac{t_2 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1}{\sigma_e} \right) - \Phi\left( \frac{t_1 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1}{\sigma_e} \right) = 0.116\\
P_{13} &= 1 - \Phi\left( \frac{t_2 - \hat{h}_1 - \hat{c}_2 - \hat{u}_1}{\sigma_e} \right) = 0.071
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, $\sigma_e$ is the standard deviation of residual variance ($\sqrt{\sigma_e^2}$) because the formula is based on the standardization of the latent variable. The probabilities are very similar to the reference results for all sires (p.229).
