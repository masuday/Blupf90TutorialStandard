In this chapter, we perform several analyses using simple linear models with BLUPF90. The program creates and solves mixed model equations. These small examples will give you a basic understanding of how to prepare a dataset, write a parameter file, and run the program. Even if you are interested in other software or more complex models, we recommend starting with this chapter.
